Slug Share is a website to advocate for justice, transparency, and community building here at UCSC. With our website, students can create an account, login, and post on our main feed. Posts are filtered under Petitions, Events, and Share Requests. 
Petitions contain petitions and causes related to UCSC that students can support and interact with to promote justice. The events tab contains upcoming events that students can register for and attend, making these opportunities more accessible. Finally, 
the Share Requests tab contains requests that UCSC students have made for items or favors that other students can respond to. This allows people to access the things they need, promoting equity and community-building.
